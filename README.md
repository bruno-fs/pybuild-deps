CLI tools to help dealing with python build dependencies. It aims to complement
tools that can pin dependencies like `pip-tools` and `poetry`.
For users relying exclusively on python wheels, those tools are more than enough.
However, for users building applications from source, finding and pinning build dependencies
is required for reproducible builds.

`pybuild-deps` might be useful for developers that need to explicitly declare
**all** dependencies for compliance reasons or supply chain concerns.

## Features

- generate pinned build requirements from requirements.txt files.
